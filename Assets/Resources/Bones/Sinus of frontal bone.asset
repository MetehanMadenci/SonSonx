  boneName: Sinus of frontal bone
  boneModelName: Sinus of frontal bone
  boneDescription: The frontal sinus has several potential functions. The mucosal
    lining helps to warm and humidify inhaled air entering from the nasal cavity,
    whilst its presence as a hollow space in the frontal bone lightens the mass of
    the skull, allowing the muscles that move the head and neck to work more efficiently.

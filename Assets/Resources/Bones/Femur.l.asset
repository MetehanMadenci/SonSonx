  boneDescription: The femur or thigh bone is the longest, most voluminous and strongest
    bone in the body of mammals. It forms part of the hip and knee. The word femur
    is the Latin word for thigh. The term femur bone is more accurate than femur,
    because the femur corresponds to the thigh, and the femur bone qualifies the
    bone inside the thigh.

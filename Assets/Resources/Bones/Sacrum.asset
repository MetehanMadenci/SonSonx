  boneDescription: 'The sacrum (Latin: os sacrum) is a large, triangular-shaped bone
    in the lower part of the spine in human anatomy. It is formed by the fusion of
    the first to fifth sacral vertebrae (S1-S5). The vertebrae that form the sacrum
    begin to fuse at age 12. Although it can be said that the person is younger than
    20 when gaps are seen between the vertebrae, complete fusion of the vertebrae
    usually occurs after age 25. At its base, called the basis ossis sacri, is the
    joint with the fifth lumbar vertebra (L5), and at its "top", called the apex
    ossis sacri, is the joint with the coccyx. There are L-shaped joints on the right
    and left (lateral edges) for the joints with the ilium (sacroiliac joint). The
    anterior protrusion of the first vertebra (S1) that forms the sacrum is called
    the promontorium.'

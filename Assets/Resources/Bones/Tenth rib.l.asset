  boneDescription: Each of the flat bones that join with the ribs, breastbone and
    vertebrae to form the rib cage, 12 on the right and left, for a total of 24.
    They form the parallel bones of the rib cage that surround the chest. The upper
    7 pairs connect to the breast bone by articulating with cartilage in the front
    of the chest (true ribs). The 8th, 9th and 10th pairs are called false ribs,
    and they join with the cartilage of the 7th rib. The 11th and 12th pairs (floating
    ribs) swing freely, and do not connect to the breast bone. With the exception
    of the first pair, the outer surfaces of the ribs can be felt under the skin.

  boneDescription: 'Ulna or ulnar bone (plural: ulnae or ulnas)[ 3 ], is a long bone
    in the forearm that extends from the elbow to the wrist. It is on the same side
    of the forearm as the little finger and runs parallel to the radius, the other
    long bone of the forearm. The ulna, which is longer and thinner than the radius,
    is considered the smaller long bone of the lower arm. The corresponding bone
    in the lower leg is the fibula.'

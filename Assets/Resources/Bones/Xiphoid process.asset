  boneDescription: The xiphoid process is the lowest part of your sternum (the distal
    end). It's the pointed bottom of the sternum that's in the center of your chest,
    where your ribcage connects to your sternum, right above your diaphragm. It's
    connected to the rest of your sternum by a symphysis.

  boneDescription: The shoulder blade or shoulder bone (Latin scapula singular, scapulae
    plural) is a flat, wide bone located at the back of the rib cage, connecting
    the humerus bone, where the arm meets the body, and the clavicle bone above the
    shoulder. It is named because its triangular shape resembles a shovel. The shoulder
    blades are included in the flat bones. The area between the two scapulae is called
    the withers. The scapula forms the back of the shoulder girdle. In humans, it
    is a flat bone roughly triangular in shape, located at the posterolateral part
    of the rib cage. [1] The scapula is the first of the forelimb bones and is located
    at the top. It articulates with the humerus, which comes after it, by a joint
    called the articulatio humeri.
